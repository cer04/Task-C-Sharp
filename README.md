This repository contains three C# programs that solve different tasks. Below is a description of each program's functionality.

Programs
1. Average of Array and Numbers Greater Than Average
This program calculates the average of all elements in an array and then prints out the numbers that are greater than the calculated average.
Requirements:
The program should work with an array of integers.
After calculating the average of the array elements, the program must identify and print only those elements that are strictly greater than the average.

2. Reverse the Numbers Entered by the User
This program prompts the user to enter several numbers (separated by spaces), stores them in an array, and then prints those numbers in reverse order.
Requirements:
The program should read user input from the console.
The input should be processed as a list of integers.
The program should output the numbers in reverse order from how they were entered.

3. First Non-Repeating Character in a String
This program takes a string input from the user and finds the first character that does not repeat anywhere else in the string.
Requirements:
The program should loop through each character of the string.
It should identify the first character whose occurrence is unique (i.e., it doesn't appear more than once in the string).
If no non-repeating character exists, the program should inform the user.
